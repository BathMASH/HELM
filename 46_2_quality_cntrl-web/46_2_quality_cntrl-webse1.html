    </p>
    <!--l. 93
-->
    <p class="noindent">
     Techniques and methods for checking the quality of materials and the building of houses, temples,
monuments and roads have been used over the centuries. For example, the ancient Egyptians had to
make and use precise measurements and adopt very high standards of work in order to build the
Pyramids. In the Middle Ages, the Guilds were established in Europe to ensure that new entrants to
the craft/trade maintained standards. The newcomer was required to serve a long period of
apprenticeship under the supervision of a master craftsman, and had to demonstrate his ability
to produce work of the appropriate quality and standard before becoming a recognized
tradesman. In modern times the notion of quality has evolved through the stages outlined
below.

     <strong>
      Inspection
     </strong>
    </p>
    <!--l. 105
-->
    <p class="noindent">
     The Industrial Revolution introduced mass production techniques to the workplace. By
the end of the 19th century, production processes were becoming more complex and
it was beyond the capabilities of a single individual to be responsible for all aspects of
production. It is impossible to inspect quality into a product in the sense that a faulty product
cannot be put right by means of inspection alone. Statistical quality control can and does
provide the environment within which the product is manufactured correctly the first
time. A process called acceptance sampling improves the average quality of the items
accepted by rejecting those items which are of unacceptable quality. In the 1920s, mass
production brought with it the production line and assembly line concepts. Henry Ford
revolutionised car production with the introduction of the mass production of the &lsquo;Model
T.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <!--l. 116
-->
    <p class="noindent">
     Mass production resulted in greater output and lower prices, but the quality of manufactured output
became more variable and less reliable. There was a need to tackle the problem of the production of
goods and parts of a fixed quality and standard. The solution was seen to be in the establishment of
inspection routines, under the supervision of a Quality Inspector. The first inspection procedures
required the testing of the entire production - a costly, time consuming and inefficient form of sorting
out good and defective items.

     <strong>
      Quality Control
     </strong>
    </p>
    <!--l. 125
-->
    <p class="noindent">
     The Second World War brought with it the need for defect-free products. Inspection departments
now came to control the production process, and this resulted in the conformance to set
specifications (the reduction of variability and the elimination of defects) being monitored and
controlled throughout production. Quality Control departments were separate from, and independent
of, the manufacturing departments.

     <strong>
      Quality Assurance
     </strong>
    </p>
    <!--l. 133
-->
    <p class="noindent">
     In turn, Quality Control evolved into Quality Assurance. The function of Quality Assurance is to
focus on assuring process and product quality through operational audits, the supplying of training,
the carrying out of technical analysis, and the giving of advice on quality improvement. The role of
Quality Assurance is to consult with the departments (design and production for example) where
responsibility for quality actually rests.

      Total Quality Management
     </strong>
    </p>
    <!--l. 141
-->
    <p class="noindent">
     Quality Assurance has given way to Company Wide Quality Management or Total Quality
Management. As the names imply, quality is no longer seen to be the responsibility of a single
department, but has become the responsibility and concern of each individual within an organisation.
A small executive group sets the policy which results in targets for the various sections within the
company. For example, line management sets &lsquo;do-able&rsquo;&nbsp;objectives; engineers to design attractive,
reliable, and functional products; operators to produce defect-free products and staff in
contact with customers to be prompt and attentive. Total Quality Management aims
to measure, detect, reduce, eliminate, and prevent quality lapses, it should include not
only products but also services, and address issues like poor standards of service and late
deliveries.

     <strong>
      Statistical Quality Control
     </strong>
    </p>
    <!--l. 154
-->
    <p class="noindent">
     As a response to the impracticality of inspecting every production item, methods involving sampling
techniques were suggested. The behaviour of samples as an indicator of the behaviour of the entire
population has a strong statistical body of theory to support it.
    </p>
    <!--l. 159
-->
    <p class="noindent">
     A landmark in the development of statistical quality control came in 1924 as a result of the work of
Dr. Walter Shewhart during his employment at Bell Telephone Laboratories. He recognised that in a
manufacturing process there will always be variation in the resulting products. He also recognized
that this variation can be understood, monitored, and controlled by statistical procedures. Shewhart
developed a simple graphical technique - the control chart - for determining if product
variation is within acceptable limits. In this case the production process is said to be &lsquo;in
control&rsquo;&nbsp;and control charts can indicate when to leave things alone or when to adjust or
change a production process. In the latter cases the production process is said to be &lsquo;out of
control.&rsquo;&nbsp;Control charts can be used (importantly) at different points within the production
process.
    </p>
    <!--l. 170
-->
    <p class="noindent">
     Other leading pioneers in the field of quality control were Dr. H. Dodge and Dr. H. Romig.
Shewhart, Dodge and Romig were responsible for much of the development of quality control based
on sampling techniques. These techniques formed what has become known as &lsquo;acceptance
sampling.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <!--l. 175
-->
    <p class="noindent">
     Although the techniques of acceptance sampling and control charts were not widely adopted initially
outside Bell, during the 1920s many companies had established inspection departments as a means
of ensuring quality.
    </p>
    <!--l. 179
-->
    <p class="noindent">
     During the Second World War, the need for mass produced products came to the fore and
in the United States in particular, statistical sampling and inspection methods became
widespread. After the Second World War, the Japanese in particular became very successful in
the application of statistical techniques to quality control and in the United States, Dr.
W.E. Deming and Dr. J.M. Duran spread the use of such techniques further into U.S.
industry.

      Statistical Process Control
     </strong>
    </p>
    <!--l. 187
-->
    <p class="noindent">
     The aim of statistical process control is to ensure that a given manufacturing process is
as stable (in control) as possible and that the process operates around stated values
for the product with as little variability as possible. In short, the aim is the reduction
of variability to ensure that each product is of a high a quality as possible. Statistical
process control is usually thought of as a toolbox whose contents may be applied to solve
production-related quality control problems. Essentially the toolbox contains the major tools
called:
    </p>

     <li class="itemize">
      the Histogram;
     </li>

    </ul>
    <!--l. 207

    <p class="noindent">
     Note that some authors argue that experimental design methods should not be regarded as a
statistical process control tool since experimental design is an active process involving the deliberate
change of variables to determine their effect, while the other methods are based purely on the
observation of an existing process.

     Control charts are a very powerful tool in the field of statistical process control. Before
looking in some detail at control charts in general we will look at the relationship between
specification limits and tolerance limits since this can and does influence the number of defective
items produced by a manufacturing process. It is this quantity that control charts seek to
minimize.

     in the case of the lengths), there is no reason why this should always be so. These limits are
called the specification limits. During manufacture, some variation in dimensions will
occur by chance. These variations can be measured by using the standard deviation of the
distribution followed by the dimensions produced by the manufacturing process. Figure 1
below shows two normal distributions each with so-called
     <strong>

     Taking these limits implies that virtually all of the manufactured articles will fall within the natural
tolerance limits. Notice that in the top part of the figure the specification limits are rather wider than
the natural tolerance limits and that little if any wastage will be produced. One could argue
that in this case the manufacturing process is actually better than it needs to be and
that this may carry unnecessary costs. In the lower part of the figure the specification
limits are narrower than the natural tolerance limits and wastage will occur In general, a
production process should aim to equate the two types of limits to minimize both costs and
wastage.

      Control Charts
     </strong>
    </p>
    <!--l. 239
-->
    <p class="noindent">
     Any production process is subject to variability. Essentially, this variability falls into two categories
called
     <strong>
      chance causes
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      assignable causes
     </strong>
     . A production process exhibiting only chance causes
is usually described as being &lsquo;in control&rsquo;&nbsp;or &lsquo;in statistical control&rsquo;&nbsp;whereas a production process
exhibiting assignable causes is described as being &lsquo;out of control.&rsquo;&nbsp;The basic aim of control charts is
the improvement of production processes via the detection of variability due to assignable causes. It
is then up to people such as process operators or managers to find the underlying cause
of the variation and take action to correct the process. Figure 4 below illustrates the
point.

     A control chart basically consists of a display of &lsquo;quality characteristics&rsquo;&nbsp;which are found from
samples taken from production at regular intervals. Typically the mean, together with a measure of
the variability (the range or the standard deviation) of measurements taken from the items being
produced may be the variables under consideration. The appearance of a typical control chart is
shown below in Figure 5.
    </p>
    <!--l. 259
-->
    <p class="noindent">
     The centre line on Figure 5 represents the ideal value of the characteristic being measured. Ideally,
the points on the figure should hover around this value in a random manner indicating that only
chance variation is present in the production process. The upper and lower limits are chosen in such
a way that so long as the process is in statistical control, virtually all of the points plotted
will fall between these two lines. Note that the points are joined up so that it is easier
to detect any trends present in the data. At this stage, a note of caution is necessary.
The fact that a particular control chart shows all of its points lying between the upper
and lower limits does not necessarily imply that the production process is in control. We
will look at this aspect of control charts in some depth later in this booklet. For now
simply note that even points lying within the upper and lower limits that do not exhibit
random behaviour can indicate that a process is either out of control or going out of
control.

coffee. As this is an electro-mechanical process, repeated over a long period of time, it is inevitable
that there will be some degree of variation in the amounts of coffee dispensed. The question that
production engineers will need to answer is &ldquo;Is the variation sufficient to result in a significant
&lsquo;underfilling&rsquo;, or &lsquo;overfilling&rsquo;, of the packets?&rdquo;&nbsp;

     In a production process, samples are taken at regular intervals, say every 10 mins., 15 mins., 30
mins, and so on, so that at least 25 samples (say) are taken. At this stage, we will be
able to detect trends - looked at later in this workbook - in the data. This can be very
important to production engineers who are expected to take corrective action to prevent a
production process going out of control. The size of the sample can vary, but in general

     Note that if the process is in control, the probability that a sample mean will fall outside the
control limits is very small. From the central limit theorem we know that the sample means
follow (or at least approximately follow) a normal distribution and from tables it is easy
to show that the probability of a sample mean falling outside the region defined by the

that there could be problems with the production process. As noted before the process is then said to
be out of control and process engineers will have to locate the cause of the unusual value of the
sample mean.

     Control charts can also be used to detect trends in the production process. Even when all of the
sample means fall within the control limits, the existence of a trend can show the presence of
one, or more, assignable causes of variation which can then be identified and brought
under control. For example, due to wear in a machine, the process mean may have shifted
slightly.

     Many control charts have a common appearance with a central line indicating a mean, a fixed
setting, or perhaps a percentage of defective items, when the process is in control. In addition, the
charts include control limits that indicate the bounds within which the process is deemed to be in
control. A notable exception to this is the CUSUM chart. This chart is not considered here, but see,
for example,

     A Pareto diagram or
     <strong>
      Pareto chart
     </strong>
     is a special type of graph which is a combination line graph and
bar graph. It provides a visual method for identifying significant problems. These are arranged in a
bar graph by their relative importance. Associated with the work of Pareto is the work of Joseph
Juran who put forward the view that the solution of the &lsquo;vital few&rsquo;&nbsp;problems are more
important than solving the &lsquo;trivial many&rsquo;&nbsp;. This is often stated as the &lsquo;80 &ETH; 20 rule&rsquo;&nbsp;;
i.e. 20% of the problems (the vital few) result in 80% of the failures to reach the set
standards.
    </p>
    <!--l. 612
-->
    <p class="noindent">
     In general terms the Pareto chart is not a problem-solving tool, but it is a tool for analysis. Its
function is to determine which problems to solve, and in what order. It aims to identify and eliminate
major problems, leading to cost savings.
    </p>
    <!--l. 617
-->
    <p class="noindent">
     Pareto charts are a type of bar chart in which the horizontal axis represents categories of interest,
rather than a continuous scale. The categories are often types of defects. By ordering the bars from
largest to smallest, a Pareto chart can help to determine which of the defects comprise the vital few
and which are the trivial many. A cumulative percentage line helps judge the added contribution of
each category. Pareto charts can help to focus improvement efforts on areas where the largest gains
can be made.
